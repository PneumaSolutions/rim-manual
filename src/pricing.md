# Pricing
Remote Incident Manager is useful in a wide array of scenarios of varying frequency. Thus, our pricing structure makes every reasonable attempt to meet you where you are. Additionally, remember that RIM is always free for the person receiving help.
# Free Tier
Anyone can use RIM to assist another user for up to 30 minutes a day.
# Consumer Pricing
## Passes
Passes are useful if you're providing assistance on an as needed basis, as they allow you to do this regardless of whether you hold an active subscription or not. When you pay for a pass, that pass will wait patiently for you to activate it whenever you are able. This also means that you can hold several passes in storage and use them whenever they're needed.
### Incident Pass ($10)
An incident pass will allow you to assist a single user for as long as is needed over a 24 hour period. At any point during the 24 hour period, reconnections can be made.
### Day Pass
A day pass will allow you to assist several users over a 24 hour period. So if you have multiple errands to run, you'll want one of these.
## Unattended Access Subscriptions
### 1 to 1 ($9.95 per month, $100 per year)
This allows you, as the individual controller, to configure one (1) physical machine for unattended access. This is useful if you have a desktop at home to which you'll want to access while on the road, or a friend or relative that you plan to provide assistance to on the regular. You can instantly switch the target machine up to 3 times per calendar year.
### 1 to 3 ($25 per month, $250 per year)
You as the individual controller can configure up to 3 targets for unattended access. Each machine can be instantly switched up to three times per calendar year.
