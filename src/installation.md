# Installation
How you acquire and install Remote Incident Manager depends on your use case and configuration, but in any case the process is quite straight forward.
## Typical Installation for Individuals
There is only one installation package to use, whether you are offering or receiving assistance.
1. [Download Remote Incident Manager](https://download.pneumasolutions.com/rim/rimsetup.exe)
1. Run the downloaded file.
1. If you have user account control enabled, press Alt+Y to approve the installation.
1. Once the file is launched, the installation will automatically commence. There are no next buttons to worry about. Just sit back, relax, and let it do its thing. Within seconds, the program will be installed and will launch automatically.
<!-- end -->
That's all there is to it! RIM will be installed and ready for use. You can either launch RIM via its desktop icon, or by pressing Windows+Shift+Backspace.
## Unattended Access Installer
If the person providing assistance has provided you a custom installer, you will be advised of this when the installer launches. This is because this installer will automatically configure RIM for what is known as unattended access. This is what will allow the person helping you to initiate a session with your computer without you having to enter a keyword. We will cover unattended access indepth later on in this manual.
